J’adore voyager et je suis donc souvent absent. À mes yeux la meilleure façon de découvrir une ville est en y vivant comme quelqu’un de local et cela passe, bien entendu, par le logement. C’est dans cette optique que lors de mes voyages je laisse mon logement à disposition des voyageurs du monde entier, alors : pourquoi pas vous ?  :)

Dear future guests,

I love travelling, so I’m often absent. For me, the best way to get to know a city is by living there like a local person, and this can only be done, of course, by getting accommodation. It is with this in mind that whenever I am travelling, I make my lodging facility available to travelers from around the world, so: why not you?

Don’t worry, even if I’m not present when you are doing the booking arrangement, Exode Bnb, to whom I have entrusted the management of my home, will make your stay as enjoyable as possible!

See you soon,

Mes amis me décriraient comme un voyageur nomade ayant une soif insatiable pour l’aventure, la découverte et les rencontres avec d’autres cultures.

Je suis également un passionné de photographie, mon rêve est d’un jour pouvoir en vivre toute en voyageant. J’ai peut-être oublié de vous dire que je suis un rêveur qui idéalise la vie.  

J’ai aussi un grand intérêt pour l’architecture, les rénovations et la décoration. 

J’adore aussi tous ce qui touche à la nature que ce soit les arbres, les fleurs ou les animaux, je crois que c’est le remède des sociétés modernes. 

Je suis simplement un passionné qui tente de profiter de chaque minute que la vie a à offrir et j'aimerais partager cela avec vous. 

----------

Airbnb est pour moi un aboutissement de plusieurs années à chercher la solution me permettant d’avoir un d’avoir un pied à terre, sans être esclave de l’entretien, sans la charge fiscale trop lourde d’une propriété, qui me permettrait d’avoir la liberté de voyager.

En tant q’hôte, Airbnb est un moyen formidable de voyager en restant à la maison et il permet de rencontrer des gens extraordinaires. L’ayant utilisé moi-même à de nombreuses reprises en tant que voyageur pour mes voyages autour du monde ou à des fins professionnel,  Airbnb est pour moi la meilleure façon de se sentir comme à la maison malgré la distance qui nous sépare de notre domicile. 

Ceci étant dit, je sais ce dont vous avez besoin pour vous sentir bien lors de vos séjour à l’extérieur, j’ai oeuvré en ce sens pour maximiser votre confort et vous offrir un séjour des plus conviviales. 
Si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit pour améliorer l’expérience n’hésitez pas à communiquer avec moi, il me fera plaisir de vous aider. 

C’est avec plaisir que je partage avec vous ma tanière, qui est mon lieu de paix dans ce monde chaotique. Soyez y bien, profitez-en et faites comme chez vous.

Mes sincères salutations, 

Christian

J'ai habité 4 ans à Reno, au Nevada (USA), pour mes études et 2 ans en France, à Paris  dans le 3e arrondissement pour le travail. 

Je loue souvent via airbnb dans le monde entier et je propose aussi mon condo à Québec.

J'ai une panoplie de recommandations à vous faire dans les quartiers les plus branchés et convoités de la ville, que ce soit pour des sorties ou des activités au centre-ville, ou aux alentours : vélo, ski alpin, raquette, concerts, restaurants, cafés, musées, bistros, shopping, pubs et plus.

Je suis une amoureuse de ma ville et elle me le rend bien !

I am passionate about travelling. I am French-Canadian and I live in Quebec City. I have also lived in Reno, Nevada for my studies and in Paris, France for work.

I have many recommandations for fun activities in town and around the city : skiing, snowshoeing, biking, concerts, restaurants, pubs, shopping, museums, etc. !

I'm a happy, easy-going and fun person who loves traveling and meeting new people through AirBnB both a host and a guest.

J’adore voyager et je suis donc souvent absent. À mes yeux la meilleure façon de découvrir une ville est en y vivant comme quelqu’un de local et cela passe, bien entendu, par le logement. C’est dans cette optique que lors de mes voyages je laisse mon logement à disposition des voyageurs du monde entier, alors : pourquoi pas vous ?  :)

Pas d’inquiétude, même si je ne suis pas présent lors de vos réservations, Exode Bnb, à laquelle j’ai confié la gestion de mon logement, saura rendre votre séjour aussi agréable que possible !

A très vite,

Dear future guests,

I love travelling, so I’m often absent. For me, the best way to get to know a city is by living there like a local person, and this can only be done, of course, by getting accommodation. It is with this in mind that whenever I am travelling, I make my lodging facility available to travelers from around the world, so: why not you?

Don’t worry, even if I’m not present when you are doing the booking arrangement, Exode Bnb, to whom I have entrusted the management of my home, will make your stay as enjoyable as possible!

See you soon,

Recevoir simplement. Accueillir chaleureusement. Partager et s’unir pour mieux grandir. 
 
Et puis, en grandissant, recevoir n’était plus simplement naturel, c’était nécessaire.
Alors du haut de nos valeurs les plus sincères, on en a fait un métier: 
 
Rendre des lieux d’évasion entre ville et montagne accessibles et accueillants pour rassembler et partager.
