Recevoir simplement. Accueillir chaleureusement. Partager et s’unir pour mieux grandir. 
 
Et puis, en grandissant, recevoir n’était plus simplement naturel, c’était nécessaire.
Alors du haut de nos valeurs les plus sincères, on en a fait un métier: 
 
Rendre des lieux d’évasion entre ville et montagne accessibles et accueillants pour rassembler et partager.

Quand il y en a pour 5, il y en a pour 6, répétait ma mère. La porte ouverte et le cœur accueillant. 
 
Chez nous, le chalet était un lieu sacré, un 600 pi2 qui pouvait recevoir autant de personne que notre cœur était prêt à en recevoir. 
 
Recevoir simplement. Accueillir chaleureusement. Partager et s’unir pour mieux grandir. 
 
Et puis, en grandissant, recevoir n’était plus simplement naturel, c’était nécessaire.
Alors du haut de nos valeurs les plus sincères, on en a fait un métier: 
 
Rendre des lieux d’évasion entre ville et montagne accessibles et accueillants pour rassembler et partager. 
 
Aujourd’hui notre grande famille compte 40 établissements dans lesquels se multiplient les souvenirs. ",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-19909639/original/64c85439-d1c2-4dd3-af76-3f7a7df1975d.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-19909639/original/64c85439-d1c2-4dd3-af76-3f7a7df1975d.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,97,145,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Saint-Roch,,46.81468,-71.22081,Entire condo,Entire home/apt,4,1.0,1 bath,1.0,2.0,"[""Ethernet connection"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Fast wifi \u2013 755 Mbps"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Elevator"", ""40 inch HDTV with Disney+"", ""Freezer"", ""Smart lock"", ""Gym"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Oven"", ""Dryer"", ""Essentials"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Self check-in"", ""Body soap"", ""Fire pit"", ""Heating"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Toaster"", ""Shared BBQ grill: gas"", ""Coffee"", ""Bed linens"", ""Pool"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""First aid kit"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Hot water"", ""Mosquito net"", ""Hangers"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Iron"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Exercise equipment"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Stove"", ""Coffee maker: Nespresso"", ""Washer"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Paid parking garage off premises"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Microwave"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Shower gel"", ""Dining table"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Kitchen"", ""Shampoo""]",$125.00,2,1125,2,2,2,1125,2.0,407.5,,t,8,24,54,303,2024-11-09,52,15,0,2022-09-24,2024-09-30,4.73,4.77,4.81,4.9,4.88,4.46,4.63,"311269, expires: 2025-01-09",t,50,50,0,0,2.01

Dear future guests,

I love travelling, so I’m often absent. For me, the best way to get to know a city is by living there like a local person, and this can only be done, of course, by getting accommodation. It is with this in mind that whenever I am travelling, I make my lodging facility available to travelers from around the world, so: why not you?

Don’t worry, even if I’m not present when you are doing the booking arrangement, Exode Bnb, to whom I have entrusted the management of my home, will make your stay as enjoyable as possible!
